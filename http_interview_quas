# What is HTTP?

## Introduction
**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is a communication protocol used for transferring data between a web browser (client) and a web server. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web, allowing users to access websites and web applications.

## How HTTP Works?
1. **Client Request**: When you enter a URL in your browser, it sends an HTTP request to the web server.  
2. **Server Response**: The server processes the request and sends back the requested web page or data.  
3. **Rendering**: The browser receives the response and displays the web page.  

## Key Features of HTTP
- **Stateless**: Each request is independent, meaning the server does not remember previous interactions.
- **Uses TCP/IP**: HTTP works over the TCP/IP protocol for reliable data transfer.
- **Common HTTP Methods**:
  - **GET** â€“ Retrieves data from the server.
  - **POST** â€“ Sends data to the server.
  - **PUT** â€“ Updates existing data.
  - **DELETE** â€“ Removes data from the server.

## Difference Between HTTP & HTTPS
| Feature | HTTP | HTTPS |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Security** | Data is transferred in plain text, making it less secure. | Uses SSL/TLS encryption for secure data transmission. |
| **Port** | 80 | 443 |
| **Usage** | Used for non-sensitive data | Used for secure transactions (banking, login, etc.) |

## Conclusion
HTTP is an essential protocol that powers web communication. However, for security reasons, HTTPS is now widely used to ensure data privacy and integrity.
