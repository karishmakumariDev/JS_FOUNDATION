# Recursion and Stack

## Introduction
Recursion is a powerful programming concept that helps solve complex problems by breaking them into smaller, similar subproblems. A recursive function is a function that calls itself to solve a problem.

## Understanding Recursion
A recursive function has two main parts:
1. **Base Case**: The condition where the recursion stops.
2. **Recursive Case**: The part where the function calls itself with a smaller problem.

## Example: Calculating Power (x^n)
Let's write a function `pow(x, n)` that calculates `x` raised to the power `n`.

### Iterative Approach (Using Loop)
```javascript
function pow(x, n) {
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result *= x;
  }
  return result;
}

console.log(pow(2, 3)); // Output: 8
```

### Recursive Approach
```javascript
function pow(x, n) {
  if (n == 1) {
    return x;
  } else {
    return x * pow(x, n - 1);
  }
}

console.log(pow(2, 3)); // Output: 8
```

### Breakdown of Recursive Calls:
For `pow(2, 3)`, the function executes as follows:
```
pow(2, 3) = 2 * pow(2, 2)
pow(2, 2) = 2 * pow(2, 1)
pow(2, 1) = 2
```
The function keeps calling itself until `n` becomes `1`, which is the **base case**.

## Advantages of Recursion
- Makes code shorter and easier to understand.
- Useful in problems involving tree structures, graphs, and nested objects.
- Can simplify complex problems.

## Disadvantages of Recursion
- Uses more memory due to function calls stored in the call stack.
- If the base case is not defined properly, it may lead to infinite recursion.
- Recursive functions have a depth limit in JavaScript (around 10,000 calls in most engines).

## Optimizing Recursion
To avoid excessive memory usage, recursion can be optimized using **Tail Call Optimization** (TCO). However, not all JavaScript engines support TCO.

### Example of Tail-Optimized Recursion:
```javascript
function pow(x, n, result = 1) {
  if (n == 0) return result;
  return pow(x, n - 1, x * result);
}

console.log(pow(2, 3)); // Output: 8
```

## Conclusion
Recursion is a powerful technique for solving problems involving repetitive structures. However, it should be used carefully to avoid performance issues. In many cases, iterative approaches can be more efficient. Understanding when to use recursion is key to writing effective code.

### What is Recursion?
Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem. This continues until it reaches a base condition that stops further calls.

Example: Calculating `x^n` (x raised to the power n)

#### Iterative Method (Using a Loop):
```js
function pow(x, n) {
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result *= x;
  }
  return result;
}
console.log(pow(2, 3)); // Output: 8
```

#### Recursive Method:
```js
function pow(x, n) {
  if (n == 1) {
    return x;
  } else {
    return x * pow(x, n - 1);
  }
}
console.log(pow(2, 3)); // Output: 8
```

**How Recursion Works:**
- `pow(2, 3) = 2 * pow(2, 2)`
- `pow(2, 2) = 2 * pow(2, 1)`
- `pow(2, 1) = 2` (Base condition reached, stops recursion)
- Now, it returns back step-by-step:
  - `pow(2, 2) = 2 * 2 = 4`
  - `pow(2, 3) = 2 * 4 = 8`

### Execution Context and Stack
Each function call has its own **execution context**, which stores:
1. Function arguments
2. Local variables
3. The line of code being executed

When a function calls another function (including itself recursively), JavaScript stores the current execution in a **stack** and moves to the new function call. Once a function completes, its execution context is removed from the stack, and JavaScript resumes the previous function.

#### Example of Stack during `pow(2,3)` Execution:
```
Call pow(2,3) → Store context in stack
Call pow(2,2) → Store context in stack
Call pow(2,1) → Store context in stack
Return 2 → Remove pow(2,1) from stack
Return 4 → Remove pow(2,2) from stack
Return 8 → Remove pow(2,3) from stack
```

### Memory Usage in Recursion vs Iteration
- **Recursive Method**: Uses **more memory** because each function call stores an execution context in the stack.
- **Iterative Method**: Uses **less memory**, as it modifies variables in a single function call.

### When to Use Recursion?
✅ When a problem is naturally recursive (like tree traversal, factorial, Fibonacci, etc.)
✅ When shorter, more readable code is preferred over memory optimization

### When to Avoid Recursion?
❌ When dealing with large numbers (risk of stack overflow)
❌ When performance and memory usage are critical

### Conclusion
- Recursion is powerful but should be used wisely.
- The execution stack plays an important role in handling function calls.
- Iterative methods are often more efficient, but recursion can make code simpler and more elegant.
