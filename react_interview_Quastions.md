# What is ReactJS?

ReactJS is a JavaScript library used to build reusable components for the view layer in MVC architecture. It is used to build the Single Page Application (SPA) due to its component-based architecture, efficient re-rendering with the Virtual DOM, and ability to manage dynamic content without needing full page reloads. It is written in JSX.

## Important Features of React

- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render components, ensuring fast performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: React builds UI using reusable, isolated components, making code more modular, maintainable, and scalable.
- **Hooks**: React Hooks allow functional components to manage state and side effects, making them powerful and more flexible.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: React can be used for server-side rendering, where HTML content is generated on the server and sent to the client. This improves the appâ€™s performance, especially for SEO.
- **React Router**: React Router enables navigation in a React application. It allows you to define different routes for different views in a single-page application (SPA).

# Explain the MVC Architecture

The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture is a design pattern used to separate an application into three main parts, making it easier to manage and scale:

## Components of MVC:

1. **Model**:
   - Represents the **data** or **business logic** of the application.
   - It communicates with the database or any data source and updates the data.
   - The Model is responsible for maintaining the state of the application.

2. **View**:
   - The **UI (User Interface)** that the user interacts with.
   - It displays data from the Model to the user and sends user inputs to the Controller.
   - The View only shows the output and is responsible for presenting the data.

3. **Controller**:
   - Acts as an intermediary between the **Model** and the **View**.
   - It handles user input, processes it, and updates the Model.
   - The Controller also decides which View to display based on user interactions.

## How It Works: Example

Imagine you have a **To-Do List** application. Here's how the MVC components would work:

- **Model**: 
   - Holds the data, e.g., the list of tasks (`task1`, `task2`, `task3`).
   - Provides methods to add or delete tasks.

- **View**: 
   - Displays the tasks to the user (the user sees `task1`, `task2`, etc. on the screen).
   - Allows the user to interact with the interface, like clicking a button to add or delete tasks.

- **Controller**: 
   - When the user clicks the "Add Task" button, the Controller handles that event, calls the appropriate method in the Model (to add a task), and updates the View (to show the new task).

## Example Code (Conceptual):

```javascript
// Model
class TodoModel {
  constructor() {
    this.tasks = [];  // An empty list of tasks
  }

  addTask(task) {
    this.tasks.push(task);
  }

  getTasks() {
    return this.tasks;
  }
}

// View
class TodoView {
  displayTasks(tasks) {
    console.log("To-Do List:");
    tasks.forEach(task => console.log(task));
  }
}

// Controller
class TodoController {
  constructor(model, view) {
    this.model = model;
    this.view = view;
  }

  addNewTask(task) {
    this.model.addTask(task);  // Update Model
    this.updateView();         // Update View
  }

  updateView() {
    const tasks = this.model.getTasks();
    this.view.displayTasks(tasks);  // Show tasks on the UI
  }
}

// Usage
const model = new TodoModel();
const view = new TodoView();
const controller = new TodoController(model, view);

controller.addNewTask("Buy Milk");
controller.addNewTask("Clean the House");
