# What is ReactJS?

ReactJS is a JavaScript library used to build reusable components for the view layer in MVC architecture. It is used to build the Single Page Application (SPA) due to its component-based architecture, efficient re-rendering with the Virtual DOM, and ability to manage dynamic content without needing full page reloads. It is written in JSX.

## Important Features of React

- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render components, ensuring fast performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: React builds UI using reusable, isolated components, making code more modular, maintainable, and scalable.
- **Hooks**: React Hooks allow functional components to manage state and side effects, making them powerful and more flexible.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: React can be used for server-side rendering, where HTML content is generated on the server and sent to the client. This improves the appâ€™s performance, especially for SEO.
- **React Router**: React Router enables navigation in a React application. It allows you to define different routes for different views in a single-page application (SPA).
